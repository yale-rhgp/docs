title: Women's Liberation button, blue and yellow
caption: "This is a blue and yellow button displaying the symbol for the Women's Liberation movement, a Venus symbol circumscribing a clenched fist. The object was bought from the Sisterhood Bookstore in Los Angeles around 1975. The Womenâ€™s Liberation movement, a part of the second-wave feminist movement, was active in the 1960s and 1970s. Its supporters fought for equal rights, opportunities, and personal freedom for women. \nSisterhood Bookstore was more than just a bookstore in Los Angeles: it was a neighborhood hangout spot and community organizing center, constantly displaying bulletin boards with resources and events. It was a staple during the second-wave feminist movement with books by and for women on diverse subjects such as sexuality, pregnancy, lesbian literature, politics of health, and Chicana literature. It closed in 1999 when a branch of a bookstore chain, Borders,  moved in across the street. \nCourtesy of Vivian Mayer, University of Connecticut Digital Collections, 1975."
