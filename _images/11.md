title: Letter to President Ford regarding bill banning Medicaid funding of abortion, verso
caption: "This notice to President Ford states that a bill banning Medicaid (federal) funding of abortion procedures has arrived on his desk. Proponent of the bill Kaye Pullen acknowledges that the argument of pro-abortion groups is that the ban is discriminatory because it disproportionately affects poor women seeking abortion procedures that are made possible financially through federal funds. The council for the creation of the bill makes sure that the purpose of the bill is stated as supporting abortion only in the case of family planning and emotional and social convenience of the mother. From the Betty Ford White House Papers, 1973 - 1977 collection of the First Lady General Subject Files, 1974 - 1977 series, courtesy of the Gerald R.Ford Presidential Library."
