title: We Won't Choose Between Our Lesbianism and Our Children flier 
caption: "Lesbian activists announce their march to protest against MediCal funding of abortions. The authors of the flier demand the right to choose when and if to have children. They also express a disdain for forced relations with men, stating that “Lesbians are exploding the myth that it is every woman’s natural role to take care of men for free.” Courtesy of the California Historical Society, San Francisco. An image is included on the flier, depicting a mother shrouded in shadow, her eyes closed, leaning against the sides of the wooden beams which separate her from her child. Her child’s arms are outstretched as if to reach her on the other side. Date estimate: 1978. Courtesy of The California Historical Society (CHS)."
