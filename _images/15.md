title:  Welfare, Abortion, and the Right to Work flier
caption: "The informational flier details the value of MediCal funding for abortion and childcare, especially for Black women childcare workers and the families they aid. Cutting funding is highlighted as an attack on welfare reform, families, and already underprivileged communities. The flier was created and distributed by Wages for Housework San Francisco, a grassroots women's network campaigning for recognition and payment for all caring work. Date estimate: 1978.
