caption: Kathy Jones marches with Janna, her 20-month-old child, in support of abortion rights in July 1978. Her sign displays, “We have the right to be wanted,” referring to the need for abortion in family planning. The pro-choice protest in downtown St. Louis was countered by an anti-abortion protest.
