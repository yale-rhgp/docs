title: Medicaid Abortion fact sheet
caption: Family Planning Advocates of New York State circulated this fact sheet as the cover page for a pamphlet criticizing the Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980) Supreme Court decision, which upheld constitutionality of the original Hyde amendment. The sheet asserts that the federal government was “turning its back” on poor populations, forcing them to be at the mercy of state legislators.
