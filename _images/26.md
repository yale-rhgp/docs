title: Pro-choice supporter
caption: Beverly Berman of the Pro-Choice Coalition pro-choice supporter hands out pinback buttons reading “Another Mother for Choice” at the Sherman Oaks Galleria. The sign beside her reads “In 1982, if you have a miscarriage you could be prosecuted for murder … abortion is something personal and political.” This highlights the stringent nature of some anti-abortion punishments in certain states, where women who experience miscarriage may be falsely accused of and punished for getting an abortion procedure. Dated May 10, 1981. Courtesy of Los Angeles Herald Examiner Photo Collection and photographer Dean Musgrove.
