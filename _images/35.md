caption: Radcliffe students demonstrate for abortion rights at the Government Center, 1985. After Roe, abortion rights activism, both for and against, remained a hallmark of Harvardâ€™s student life on campus. After the Roe decision, Radcliffe women pushed to expand reproductive rights while other anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups held debates in dorm rooms, editorials, and public space.
