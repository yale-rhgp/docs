title: Abortion rights protest in CWE church
caption: A group of abortion rights supporters met at a church in the Central West End in May 1985. The photo displays a sign that states, “We are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your friends and we are speaking out for our right to choose,” a statement that is staunchly pro-choice and emphasizes the large population of women affected by reproductive injustice. NARAL Pro-Choice America, founded in 1969, is a non-profit organization that advocates for expansion of reproductive rights through lobbying, political action, and advocacy efforts.
