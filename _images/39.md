title: Abortion rights protestors, 1986
caption: Abortion rights protesters march outside St. Louis University's student center during a Prolife Action Network national convention in April 1986. The signs explicitly counter the religious rhetoric used in anti-abortion arguments, including a statement that reads, “Free Women from Religious Oppression,” indiciating the Church’s role in restricting women’s reproducive freedoms.
