title: Number of Pro-Choice Marchers Surpasses Planners’ Expectations, 1989
caption: 00 Yale undergraduate, graduate, and professional students joined an estimated 500,000 protestors for a pro-choice march Sunday in Washington, D.C., surpassing even liberal estimates, writes Martha Ophir. They used chants such as “Hey, George, Yalies for Choice!” Seats for the two buses chartered for transportation to the Capitol were sold out in January. Student protestors hailed from diverse religious, political, geographical, racial and demographic backgrounds. The Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision ruled that Missouri statutes enforcing restrictions on abortions were not unconstitutional. The Yale Daily News 11 April 1989, courtesy of the YDN Archives.
