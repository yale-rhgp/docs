title: The March for Women’s Lives
caption: Demonstrators held the 1992 March for Women’s Lives in Washington DC as a response to the then pending Supreme Court case Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which was seen as a threat to Roe v. Wade. The court decision eventually upheld Roe but also affirmed most of the Pennsylvania provisions. The decision also set the precedent of "undue burden," which is defined as a "substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability."
