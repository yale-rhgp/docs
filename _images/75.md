title: TRUE PRO-LIFERS TRY TO STOP THE KILLINGâ€¦
caption: A Chuck Asay Editorial cartoon (2009) from the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph is captioned, "True pro-lifers try to stop the killing..." Panel 1. ...THIS way (Through ballot box, logic, prayer, medical facts, art, theology, debate, etc.) Panel 2. ...NOT like this... a bullet box and an abortion doctor target. This is in reference to the violence against doctors who perform abortion procedures, including Dr. George Tiller in Kansas, 2009. Dr. Tiller was one of the most prominent, outspoken pro-choice doctors and activists of his time. Courtesy of the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph.
