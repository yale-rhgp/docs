title: Pro-choice protestor, San José State University
caption: A woman holds a poster advocating for abortion rights, which reads, "Our bodies, our lives, our right to decide. Abortion without apology. We won't go back!" This is an early use of the slogan “Abortion without apology,” indicating an increasingly firm, unapologetic stance. The sign also depicts a woman shouting and a bloody coathanger. Photo by Ted Sahl.
