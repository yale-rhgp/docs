title: Demonstrators outside the Missouri House of Representatives, 2019
caption: Demonstrators protest against a new bill that would virtually ban all abortions in the state outside the Missouri House of Representatives chamber in the state capitol on May 17, 2019. A demonstrator holds up a sign that reads, “I’m a person, NOT an INCUBATOR,” expression frustration at anti-abortion laws which treat women like vessels for carrying babies rather than autonomous beings with the right to reproductive freedom.
