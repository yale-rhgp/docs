caption: Some protestors marching down Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, on May 25, 2019 are dressed like characters from the novel The Handmaid’s Tale, which details the horrors of a surveillance government that dictates women’s reproduction, to foreshadow the future of America should the trend of anti-abortion policies continue down its current trajectory. The protest was organized to oppose a proposed bill that would ban abortion after six weeks. Photograph by Emily Kask, courtesy of Kask/AFP/Getty Images.
