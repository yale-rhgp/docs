caption: A collage by Pema Choedon depicts protestors with signs at a pro-abortion rally held by the advocacy group Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights in Harvard Square, 2022. The signs read, “FORCED MOTHERHOOD IS FEMALE ENSLAVEMENT,” “WE REFUSE TO LET THE U.S SUPREME COURT DENY WOMEN'S HUMANITY AND DECIMATE THEIR RIGHTS!,” “ABORTION ON DEMAND & WITHOUT APOLOGY!,” and “STOP THE EVIL TEXAS JERKS. SAVE ABORTION.” The protestors link the loss of safe, legal abortion as a detrimental loss for bodily autonomy, women’s rights, and humanity. Courtesy of the Harvard Crimson.
