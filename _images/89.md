title: Pro-choice march, LA, 2021
caption: "Pro-abortion rights protesters during a Los Angeles march, 2021. Signs read, “PUBLIC CERVIX ANNOUNCEMENT: I AM A WOMAN NOT A WOMB,” “PRO CHOICE, MY BODY IS NOT A POLITICAL PLAYGROUND,” “KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA.” Signs use increasingly explicit language and mention parts of a women’s reproductive system, perhaps in contrast to the conservative, religious rhetoric of anti-abortion groups, and to highlight the stark reality of the physical violence of laws that aim to restrict reproductive rights.
